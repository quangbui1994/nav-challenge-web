TECHNOLOGY AND FRAMEWORK:

-The application basically is rendered initially from server using Express framework, then hydrated by React library. 
-The skeleton HTML left off from server is taken over by React later and rendered as normal app.
-This approach combines the advantages of both server side render and client side render methods which allows the browser could
load the fully rendered HTML and serve to the user faster, meanwhile keeps the benefits from SPA. Besides, rendering complete HTML
also improve the SEO of app compared to SPA.
